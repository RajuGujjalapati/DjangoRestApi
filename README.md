# DjangoRestApi
An Intro To Django Rest Framework
# what is [API](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Application_programming_interface)?
An application programming interface (API) is a computing interface which defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries.
When you use an application on your mobile phone, the application connects to the Internet and sends data to a server.
The server then retrieves that data, interprets it, performs the necessary actions and sends it back to your phone. 
The application then interprets that data and presents you with the information you wanted in a readable way. 
This is what an API is - all of this happens via API.

**Example :**
Imagine you’re sitting at a table in a restaurant with a menu of choices to order from. 
The kitchen is the part of the “system” that will prepare your order. 
What is missing is the critical link to communicate your order to the kitchen and deliver your food back to your table. 
That’s where the waiter or API comes in. The waiter is the messenger – or API – that takes your request or order and tells the kitchen – the system – what to do.
Then the waiter delivers the response back to you; in this case, it is the food.

# what is Rest ?
 REST is a way for two computer systems to communicate over HTTP in a similar way to web browsers and servers.<br>
REST suggests to create an object of the data requested by the client and send the values of the object in response to the user. <br>
Sharing data between two or more systems has always been a fundamental requirement of software development.<br>
For example, consider buying motor insurance. Your insurer must obtain information about you and your vehicle so they request data from car registration authorities, credit agencies, banks, and other systems.<br>
All this happens transparently in real-time to determine whether a policy can be offered.<br>
**RESTful web service** (it follows REST conventions).
